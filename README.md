# PyGame
Learning PyGame Python library and basic gameDev

To run this:
1. pip install pygame
2. run code from game.py

There is no too much to see. Level generate automaticaly and player can move left/right on the bloks with a/s or left/right arrow.
You can jump with space bar
Drop from the platform with "s" key but only if there is enough space under you.
'R' - Generate new level.
'Esc' - closes the game.

TODO:
Want to add enemies, collectible items, ataacks, power-ups, destructebla blocks, animation of movement
Optimization of collision agorithm:
  for now it scan every object on the map if it collides with the player. I want to make it scan only in n-block radius.
